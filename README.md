This project was conceived as a result of a final project for the course: ISTA301 Computational Art, 
a course offered by the SISTA department at the University of Arizona.

Notes

This software was a DIY MVC application for managing a curated collection of art. Additionally
it provides the functionality of generating journeys of art, which are tours through various
selections of art, which algorithmically tailors the journey based upon the user's choices.
Each selection causes the next set of offered choices to more closely match the attributes
similar to the user's previous selections. The result is a non-linear journey through art.
The goal is to provide art exposure and education, as well as providing a means for users
to create art journeys which can be shared with others.
